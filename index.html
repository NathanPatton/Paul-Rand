                <h2>The Start</h2>
                <p class="start">For those of you that have not heard of Paul Rand he was a major character in the design industry.  He was well known for his Graphic Design work and in particular corporate logo design.  Paul was born on the 15th August 1914 in Brooklyn, New York and from he was at a young age he fell in love with design.  His passion for design would lead him to become an early pioneer for the Swiss Style of graphic design, and allow him to get involved in some revolutionary projects.</p>

                <p class="spacer">Rand got his start quite small, he would design stock images for a syndicate that sold those images to magazines or newspapers but through that work he was able to create a large portfolio of work.</p><!--Spacer-->

                <p>He also decided to change his name to break ties with the jewish association to his name by renaming himself Paul Rand.  He shortened his first name to Paul and took the surname Rand from an uncle in the family to make it a more traditional American name.</p>

                <p>Rand kept his passion for design alive through his whole career.  In his early twenties he had mostly a portfolio made up of logo designs however he was approached by an arts magazine to set that page layout for their anniversary release of their magazine.  This put Paul on the radar of many companies and designers which gave him a full time job in the magazine as well as an offer to become the art director for the Esquire-Coronet magazine.  However Rand felt that he didn't have the skills required to take the job so he refused, only to accept the offer a year later at the age of just twenty-three.</p>

                <p>The art for the magazine covers that Paul created for Direction Magazine where an early sign of his style which would later become very recognisable among designers.  In December 1940 Directions cover that predominately incorporated barbed wire into the design to show crucifix and a war time gift.  Rand had the freedom to do what he wanted with his designs at Direction and that let him experiment with different ideas that where more commonly found in the high arts into his own graphic design style.</p>

                <p>He also joined Yale in 1956 and began teaching graphic design.  This lead to a generation of designers that focused on minimalism and simplicity which shook the foundations of graphic design.</p>

                <p>Paul rand was mainly known for his logo design and corporate brand identities.  He designed for huge companies many of which where only starting out at the time and have no became colossal giants in todays markets.  Just to name a few he worked with companies like ABC, IBM, Enron and even UPS.</p>

                <p>While Rand was out getting work as a graphic designer it was very seldom heard of graphic designers going out and getting jobs.  That is why today early graphic designers starting out owe a great deal to Rand because he sold his designs to a client by being a salesman and he also had the ability to show companies how design and corporate identity played a key role in their business image. The graphics designer Louis Danziger said:</p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>"He almost singlehandedly convinced business that design was an effective tool. [. . .] Anyone designing in the 1950s and 1960s owed much to Rand, who largely made it possible for us to work. He more than anyone else made the profession reputable. We went from being commercial artists to being graphic designers largely on his merits."</p>
                </blockquote>

                <p>In 1956 Paul Rand designed the corporate identity, packaging, logo and marketing materials for IBM which put Rand on the map in the design community.  Also if you have seen the icon version of the IBM logo that was his work, they eye bumble bee and the M which he made in 1981 created a powerful brand for IBM as their campaign caught they eye of many viewers.  The poster used a visual pun which was seldom used in poster design, as well as a black poster background which seemed to be carries through in his other styles with a flat minimalist look.</p>

                <p>Rand also incorporated stripes into the IBM logo which worked really well with the design and helped grab the attention of the audience.  The logo also suggested efficiency and speed which perfectly summed up IBM and their business model. </p>

                <p>With the spotlight on Rand after the IBM design Ford got in contact and asked him to redesign their corporate logo in the 1960s but once the work was completed Ford decided not to use the new, modern and more cleanly designed logo.</p>

                <p>He also designed the logo for Harcourt Brace and Company back in 1957.  This design was a beautifully timeless logo.  It was a box half red and half blue with the Letters HB carved into it, even today this design would fit with the design style.</p>

                <p>Another example of some of his brilliant work was the John David Stores logo he made in 1965.  It’s simplistic black rounded box and beautiful Sans-Serif typeface broke away from the normal style of design back in the 60’s but it worked in his favour as it achieved minimalism which was what Rand wanted out of all of his designs.</p>

                <p>After Steve Jobs was taken of the Lisa and the Macintosh projects for the lack of sales, the company lost millions of dollars in unsold inventory and stocks started to plummet.  On September 13th 1985 Steve Jobs finally resigned from Apple as it was not the company he started, he created NeXT Computer and took several of Apples best employees from the supermicro devision to create personal computers and software that wouldn't rival Apple but rather work alongside them.</p>

                <p>It was then that Paul Rand created the corporate identity for NeXT.  The design was extremely minimalist which was typical of Rands style as well as the Swiss style of design. The logo which consisted of 4 colours and black was eye catching and modern at the time and perfectly suited the NeXT company.  Steve Jobs loved the logo and even said the he was "the greatest living graphic designer.".</p>
                
                <h2 class="later">His Later Years</h2>
                
                <p>Paul Rand continued to fine tune and tweak his design style in his later age and took on many more projects.  For some of his designs it was rumoured that he would charge <strong>$100,000</strong> for a single design.  He also started to write his memoirs which can be read today and can even be found online.</p>

                <p>He was very isolated during his creative process even when he was working for large companies and had a large number of staff working for him Rand always wanted to create on his own.  He also took more and more advice from one of his biggest inspirations Maholy-Nagy.  When Rend was asked by Maholy-Nagy if he read any art criticism at their first meeting Paul said no and Maholy-Nagy replied "Pity".  This lead Paul to read as many books as he could get his hands on.  While reading as many books as he could he came across authors and books that changed his design style for the better.  John Dewey, Roger Fry and Alfred Whitehead where some of the few that Rand discovered and that helped mould his style to a new level.  He took a method Dewey used and adapted it, he would take the design and blur and distort it as much as possible to see if it was still recognisable.</p>
                
                <p><strong>In 1996 Paul Rand died of cancer in Norwalk, Connecticut when he was 82 years old.</strong></p>
