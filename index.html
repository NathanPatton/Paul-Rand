                <h2>The Start</h2>
                <p class="start">For those of you that have not heard of Paul Rand he was a major character in the design industry.  He was well known for his Graphic Design work and in particular corporate logo design.  Paul was born on the 15th August 1914 in Brooklyn, New York and from he was at a young age he fell in love with design.  His passion for design would lead him to become an early pioneer for the Swiss Style of graphic design, and allow him to get involved in some revolutionary projects.</p>

            <section class="career">
            
                <p>Rand got his start quite small, he would design stock images for a syndicate that sold those images to magazines or newspapers but through that work he was able to create a large portfolio of work.</p>

                <p>He also decided to change his name to break ties with the jewish association to his name by renaming himself Paul Rand.  He shortened his first name to Paul and took the surname Rand from an uncle in the family to make it a more traditional American name.</p>

                <p>Rand kept his passion for design alive through his whole career.  In his early twenties he had mostly a portfolio made up of logo designs however he was approached by an arts magazine to set that page layout for their anniversary release of their magazine.  This put Paul on the radar of many companies and designers which gave him a full time job in the magazine as well as an offer to become the art director for the Esquire-Coronet magazine.  However Rand felt that he didn't have the skills required to take the job so he refused, only to accept the offer a year later at the age of just twenty-three.</p>

                <p>The art for the magazine covers that Paul created for Direction Magazine where an early sign of his style which would later become very recognisable among designers.  In December 1940 Directions cover that predominately incorporated barbed wire into the design to show crucifix and a war time gift.  Rand had the freedom to do what he wanted with his designs at Direction and that let him experiment with different ideas that where more commonly found in the high arts into his own graphic design style.</p>

                <p>He also joined Yale in 1956 and began teaching graphic design.  This lead to a generation of designers that focused on minimalism and simplicity which shook the foundations of graphic design.</p>
